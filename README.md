# Notebook 9

In this notebook we will be working with databases. Unlike other notebooks much of your answers will not be direct python code. Rather you are building a database on the given data. 

Use the `billboard.csv` file. You will need to write (or more likely copy from past assignments), code that will load that csv file. You will then need to decide how you manipulate that data before you put it in your database. 

Note some of the resources here:
`normalization.html` a resource from a peer of mine on how to normalize data with examples in R.
`docker-compose.yml` a file I created for you that you can call to build a database with a volume. 
`tidy-data.pdf` a paper that discusses the importance of 'tidy' data, and how to make your data tidy. 

Have fun!
